    "#### What are Panel tasks?\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel tasks refers to a type of learning problem where a Panel of data is employed, simply refered to as Panel Data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Panel Data comprises of multiple time series entities/instances, where a single time series component looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<INSERT TIME-SERIES, Image-1>\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, Panel Data can be visualized as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "<INSERT PANEL-DATA, Image-2>\n",
    "\n",
    "As per the kind of response variable and goal of the task, we can define different tasks - all of them are synonymous to time-independent (often called as Cross-sectional) data:\n",
    "1. _Classification_: The response variable is a label (Good / bad, ratings between 0 and 5 - 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)\n",
    "    <INSERT CLASSIFICATION-BOXES, Image-3>\n",
    "2. _Regression_: The response variable is continuous (floating point, integers)\n",
    "    <INSERT REGRESSION-PLOT FROM `utils.load_experiments(variables=\"pressure\"), Image-4`>\n",
    "3. _Clustering_: There are no response variables here, the goal of this task is to group entities that are \"similar\" to each other.\n",
    "    <INSERT CLUSTERING-PLOT, Image-5>\n",
    "4. _Forecasting_: Given historical data, predict the (near future) values by capturing temporal dependencies and patterns within each panel.\n",
    "    <TODO - Think of what image to add here, Image-6>\n",
    "5. _TODO: Add more obscure tasks (causal inference, survival analysis) or something more relevant to the talk - distances and kernel based_\n",
